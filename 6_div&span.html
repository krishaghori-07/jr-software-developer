        <span>Chhota Bheem and Kalia’s Lesson</span>
      </h2>
      <p align="center">
        In the peaceful village of Dholakpur, the sun rose bright and golden.
        Children were already playing near the river, and Chhota Bheem was
        enjoying a big bowl of laddoos given by Tun Tun Mausi. Everything seemed
        normal, but Kalia, as usual, was feeling jealous. Kalia watched Bheem
        from a distance and muttered, “Everyone only praises Bheem. Today, I
        will prove that I am better than him.” He came up with a plan to impress
        the king and make Bheem look foolish.

      <p align="justify">
        That afternoon, the king announced that a strong storm was expected, and
        the old bridge connecting the village to the farms had become weak. If
        the bridge broke, villagers would not be able to bring food supplies.
        The king asked for volunteers to help fix it. Before Bheem could step
        forward, Kalia loudly said, “Your Majesty, I will repair the bridge all
        by myself. I don’t need Bheem’s help!” The villagers were surprised, but
        the king agreed and wished him luck. Kalia went to the bridge with Dholu
        and Bholu. At first, he felt confident, but soon he realized the bridge
        was heavier and more damaged than he thought. The strong wind made it
        even harder to work. Suddenly, one wooden plank broke, and Kalia
        slipped, hanging dangerously over the river. “Help! Help!” Kalia shouted
        in fear. Hearing the noise, Chhota Bheem rushed to the spot. Without
        thinking twice, he grabbed a rope, jumped forward, and pulled Kalia up
        to safety. Dholu and Bholu were relieved. Bheem then said calmly,
        “Kalia, fixing the bridge needs teamwork. Let’s do it together.” Ashamed
        and tired, Kalia nodded. For the first time, he said, “I’m sorry, Bheem.
        I was wrong.” Together, Bheem, Kalia, and the villagers repaired the
        bridge before the storm arrived. When the king came to inspect it, he
        was very pleased. “Today, I learned something important,” the king said.
        “Strength is good, but helping others and working together is true
        greatness.” Kalia looked at Bheem and said softly, “Thank you for saving
        me.” Bheem smiled and replied, “We are all part of Dholakpur.” That
        evening, everyone celebrated. Even Kalia joined the villagers happily,
        realizing that friendship is stronger than jealousy. And once again,
        peace and happiness filled Dholakpur. 🌟 If you want, I can write: a

      <h2><span>Nobita and the Day He Didn’t Give Up</span></h2>
      <p align="right">
        One sunny morning in Tokyo, Nobita was rushing to school, already late
        as usual. He tripped on the road and fell flat. “Why am I always so
        unlucky?” he sighed. Doraemon floated beside him and said, “Nobita,
        today try something different—don’t give up so easily.” At school, the
        teacher announced a science project competition. The winner would get a
        special medal and praise from the whole school. Nobita felt nervous. He
        was not good at studies, and Gian and Suneo immediately started boasting
        about how they would win. During recess, Gian laughed and said, “Nobita,
        you should just watch us win.” Suneo added, “Yes, science is not for
        you.” Nobita felt sad and ran home crying. At home, Doraemon listened
        patiently. “Doraemon, I can never win anything,” Nobita said. Doraemon
        smiled and replied, “You don’t need gadgets every time. This time, try
        using your own ideas.”
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        Nobita thought hard and remembered how he loved watching plants grow on
        his balcony. He decided to make a simple project on how plants grow
        better with care and kindness. Every day, he watered the plants, talked
        to them, and observed them carefully. It was slow work, but Nobita
        didn’t quit. On the day of the competition, many students brought fancy
        models. Nobita felt scared again, but Doraemon whispered, “Just explain
        honestly.” When it was Nobita’s turn, he spoke about patience, care, and
        responsibility. He showed how his plant grew healthier because of
        regular attention. The class listened quietly. To everyone’s surprise,
        the teacher smiled and said, “This project is simple, but the effort is
        amazing.” Nobita won second prize. It wasn’t first place, but it was his
        biggest achievement yet. Gian and Suneo were shocked. Shizuka clapped
        happily and said, “Good job, Nobita!” That evening, Nobita looked at the
        medal and said, “Doraemon, I did it without any gadget.” Doraemon smiled
        proudly. “See? You were capable all along.” From that day on, Nobita
        still made mistakes—but he learned one important thing: Trying sincerely
        is more important than winning. 🌱✨
